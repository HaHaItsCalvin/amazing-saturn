      * <b style="color:#FFCE4B">Why Should I Join?</b> Spaces to heal are important as we all work to create social justice. Psypher aims to provide healing spaces
      through our workshops, so we're listening for what you and the community needs. The feedback from this forum will inform Psypher's immediate action items. 
      In addition, we'll follow up with a free public workshop that provides opportunities for education & expression based on the forum discussion.
      For anything outside of our scope, we will work to mobilize our community partners and resources to help address your needs.
