      to reach high school and college students throughout LA County. We have hosted over 60 workshops

          Psypher facilitates two-part workshops that engage
          students in youth-centered discussions about wellness
          and provide an expressive outlet through urban dance.
          Our dynamic team of youth advocates, mental health professionals, and urban dancers create workshops around
          topics that are informed by local youth, thus equipping them with relevant knowledge for navigating and
          promoting their well-being.
