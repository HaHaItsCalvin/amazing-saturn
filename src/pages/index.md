          "It brings together something many people struggle with alone and 
          something that brings people together, so maybe the combination can help get
          people more comfortable with the idea that they don’t have to struggle 
          alone with any mental health concerns they may be facing."

          "My first experience with the program was fantastic.
          In the dance industry, we are constantly judging,
          evaluating, & analyzing our every move, so it was
          nice to sit down to talk about these everyday things
          that affect us and our mental health."

          "Sometimes there is stuff that you feel is burdening
          you, and it’s hard to put it into words. Sometimes
          releasing it through a physical medium, through
          your body, lets you release that without having to
          say anything. That’s a cathartic experience."

          “Sitting there in a classroom full of high schoolers and listening to the information that Psypher
          taught made me wish that I had that information
          when I was their age.”

                is hearing the unique perspectives that youth
                bring to the table. It’s empowering to see
                these young people engaging in discussions
                about wellness and watching their growth
                over the course of our workshops. I also get
                to work with such an incredibly passionate,
                creative, and down-to-earth team to make it
                all happen!

                teach me about these skills and mindsets when I was
                in high school as well as encourage healthy expression through the arts in a safe, welcoming space.

        quote:  There isn’t anything else like Psypher. We start where
                it matters - with the youth. The stages of growing up
                impact who we are, how we are, and what we become;
                therefore, being able to provide an insightful wellness
                education allows us to start those conversations at a
                young age. I’m blessed and grateful to be part of this
                team by spreading the word about what we do and the
                people we impact through the lens of a camera.

                part of those moments to learn and to produce a good
                support team and has been my safe space, even to
                work alongside with an extraordinary team. Psypher
                has been encouraged me to create more awesome
                ideas that I wasn’t familiar with, and I was open-minded. With my design skills, I was to be able to help what
                wellness means. Plus I hope the youths enjoy the Instagram post we present for them.

                & knowledge for the youth. I am grateful to be working
                side by side with passionate & motivated individuals
                that share the same goals to give back to the youth!

        quote:  For me the best part of Psypher is being able to contribute to the mental health problems throughout the
                community and educate those who are unaware of
                some of the issues that our youth faces daily. I’m also
                extremely grateful and inspired to be able to work
                with so many creative and caring individuals that do
                so much to contribute to Psypher.
