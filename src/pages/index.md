      to reach high school and college students throughout LA County. We have hosted over 60 workshops

          It brings together something many people struggle with alone and 
          something that brings people together, so maybe the combination can help get
          people more comfortable with the idea that they don’t have to struggle 
          alone with any mental health concerns they may be facing.

          My first experience with the program was fantastic.
          In the dance industry, we are constantly judging,
          evaluating, & analyzing our every move, so it was
          nice to sit down to talk about these everyday things
          that affect us and our mental health.

          Sometimes there is stuff that you feel is burdening
          you, and it’s hard to put it into words. Sometimes
          releasing it through a physical medium, through
          your body, lets you release that without having to
          say anything. That’s a cathartic experience.
